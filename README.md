# Hobby Web App: GameTimeLog

My second individual project.

MVP: A functional ‘front-end’ web app (and integrated APIs) which connect to a back-end.

It involves Java source code & Spring libraries, JDBC and a SQL database hosted on Google Cloud Platform. The front end uses html, css and javascript. To manage the project I have used Git source control with IntelliJ Ultimate as my IDE. Testing with. Maven to build and Jenkins as part of my CI Pipeline to send to Sonarqube (hosted on a Google Cloud VM) and to an artifact repository (Nexus).

Presentation about the project: [on google slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wznZu-mg9XHuvzp51Q3ZPYwYu3qjcSRW8Uu_N3bzJ_g/edit?usp=sharing).

**Test Coverage:** For src/main/java: 100% // Sonarqube: 0% // Overall: 100%

For test reports and other documentation please see the project_docs folder.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

**Links for Prerequisites**

**To Run**

**To Develop**


<details>
<summary>Installing Demo</summary>

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

<summary>Running the tests</summary>

### Unit Tests 
JUnit is used for unit tests. A unit test will test individual methods within a class for functionality.

```
Give an example of why and how to run them
```

### Integration Tests 
Mockito is used for intergration testing. It tests how different classes interact with each other. By 'mocking' the functions that a method/class relies on we can see how the code we are testing works by assuming the parts it relies on work too.

```
Give an example of why and how to run them
```

### Coding style tests (static analysis)
Sonarqube is used for static analysis. I used it to see how well my code conformed to an industry standard, the amount of coverage for my tests, and also highlighting bugs and security warnings.

```
Give an example of why and how to run them
